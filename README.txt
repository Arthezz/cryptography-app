Hi!
It's my first application in JavaFx
I have done it for college project
It's also my first time when I'm using CSS

You can encrypt following characters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,. ?!_ 
To decrypt you can use: 0123456789sqrtln/- =*()^+
But you need to know combinations of these characters

I had problem with CTRL+A, CTRL+V, CTRL+C so unfortunately in decrypted text you can also press: avc
