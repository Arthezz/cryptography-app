# Cryptography Project

Hello !
I've made this program for college project. This app encrypts and decrypts inserted text by using my own cipher


## General info

I took the oportunity and I tried for the first time JavaFX framework for creating this project. It's a simple app which provides conversion of inserted text to mathematical equation.
You can encrypt following characters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,. ?!_ 
To decrypt you can use: 0123456789sqrtln/- =*()^+
But you need to know combinations of these characters. So if you want just try it out, copy encrypted text and paste it to decryption bar

### Technologies

- Java 8
- JavaFX 8
- Gluon 8.5


#### Setup

If you want to open .jar file, you will need Java SE Runtime Environment in 8 version at least


##### Remarks 

I had the problem with CTRL+A, CTRL+V, CTRL+C so unfortunately in decrypted text you can also press characters: avc
